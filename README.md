*Question Generation:*

1. The file_processing function loads the PDF file using PyPDFLoader from LangChain and concatenates the text content of all pages into a single string question_gen.

2. The question_gen text is then split into smaller chunks using TokenTextSplitter from LangChain. This is done to accommodate the input length limits of the language model used for question generation. The chunking parameters are set to a chunk size of 10,000 tokens with an overlap of 200 tokens between chunks.

3. The llm_pipeline function creates an instance of ChatOpenAI from LangChain, which is a wrapper around the OpenAI GPT-3 language model (specifically, the gpt-3.5-turbo model).

4. A prompt template is defined to instruct the language model on generating questions based on the provided text. The prompt encourages the model to create questions that will prepare coders or programmers for their exams and coding tests, ensuring important information is not lost.

5. The load_summarize_chain from LangChain is used to create a ques_gen_chain, which is a chain of components for generating questions. This chain uses the ChatOpenAI instance and the defined prompt templates.

6. The ques_gen_chain.run method is called with the document chunks (document_ques_gen) as input, and it returns a string ques containing the generated questions.

*Answer Generation:*

1. In the llm_pipeline function, the document_answer_gen list, which contains smaller text chunks for answer generation, is created using TokenTextSplitter with a chunk size of 1,000 tokens and an overlap of 100 tokens.

2. A vector store is created using FAISS.from_documents from LangChain, which stores the text chunks (document_answer_gen) as vectors (numerical representations) using OpenAIEmbeddings.

3. Another instance of ChatOpenAI is created specifically for answer generation, with a lower temperature setting (0.1) to generate more deterministic answers.

4. The generated questions (ques) are split into a list (ques_list), and a filtered list (filtered_ques_list) is created, containing only questions that end with a question mark or a period.

5. A RetrievalQA chain is created using RetrievalQA.from_chain_type from LangChain. This chain uses the ChatOpenAI instance for answer generation, the "stuff" chain type (which returns the relevant context along with the answer), and the vector store as the retriever to fetch relevant text chunks for answering the questions.

6. In the get_csv function, a loop iterates over the filtered_ques_list, and for each question, the answer_generation_chain.run method is called with the question as input. This method retrieves relevant text chunks from the vector store and generates an answer using the language model.

7. The generated questions and answers are then written to a CSV file named "QA.csv" in the "static/output/" directory.
